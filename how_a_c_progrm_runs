EXECUTION PROCESS OF A C PROGRAM

starts with a source code

the preprocessor replaces all lines that start with '#' with the 
declaration of the functions that are included in these lines. 
it also expands the macro values. output from the preprocessor 
is called expanded source code which is saved with the extension '.i'

the compiler generates assembly code from the expanded source code

the assembler converts assembly code into object file. extention '.obj / .o'

the linker will link the object code to system libraries. 
if there are multiple object codes . 
it links all of the m together as one.

the executable file '.exe' is now ready. before execution, the loader loadsthe program from hard disk to RAM of the machine, then execution is done.
